# k8s-minikube-kali-helloworld
This project guides you through deploying a simple "Hello World" Node.js application to a Kubernetes environment using Minikube on a Kali Linux system. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive, hands-on experience with core Kubernetes concepts, from containerization to scaling and updates, all within a local, free-to-use setup.
